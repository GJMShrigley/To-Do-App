        I designed this project for the purposes of teaching myself the fundamentals of React.js.
        Designing and building it came with a number of unique challenges, not least of which was
        figuring out the correct method of passing data between components.
        <br><br>
        One of the advantages of React is how it handles rendering and re-rendering its elements. by 
        only re-rendering those elements that require it (typically those which have changed in some 
        way) React is able to provide dynamic and interactive elements without being too intensive on 
        the browser's resources. It is able to do this by recording the state of its elements in a form 
        named, appropriately, 'state'. 
        <br><br>
        The app is composed of two components,'Title' and a 'Notes'. React dynamically inserts 
        these components into the HTML as needed. Notes are stored as an object in an array within 
        a React state. Every time the user adds a note using the + button, a new object is added to 
        this array and React will re-render the screen. React will run through the array of objects and
         render a new note element for each.
        <br><br>
        Each object within the array contains a number of properties that dictate how it appears on the 
        screen. This includes the text contents, whether or not the note has been 'checked' (as a 
        boolean), an ID (as an integer), and a position (as a string).
        <br><br>
        The 'React-beautiful-dnd' library allows notes to be reordered on the list by setting a 
        drag and drop context. Dragging a note anywhere inside this area will update the array by 
        removing the relevant note from its original position and returning it at the new destination. 
        Each time a note is created, it is wrapped inside a 'draggable' context which keeps track of its
        ID and position properties, and its index within the array. 
        <br><br>
        Both the Title and Note components contain buttons which toggle various effects and also a text 
        field. Typically React is only able to pass data in a single direction, from parent to child.  
        While it would be possible to allow each individual note to handle the contents of its text field 
        and other properties, this would not be good practice as it could lead to conflicts between the 
        data contained in the original array and the data of each note element.
        <br><br>
        This made it necessary to use a slightly more complex method of dealing with user input to the 
        interactive parts of each component. Instead of passing the data down to the individual note element 
        directly, I instead passed a reference to a function. Now interacting with the buttons or text field 
        of the note element will trigger the function and update the original data in the original array 
        of objects directly.
